<p> &nbsp;Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has ordered the <span style="color:blue;font-weight:bold">Navy</span> to take the rare step<br>
of renaming a ship, one that bears the name of a gay rights icon, documents and sources show.</p>

<p> &nbsp;Military.com reviewed a memorandum from the Office of the<br>
 Secretary of the Navy -- the official who holds the power to name Navy ships -- that showed<br>
 the sea service had come up with rollout plans for the renaming of the oiler ship USNS Harvey Milk.

<p> &nbsp;A defense official confirmed that the Navy was making preparations to strip the ship of its name<br>
but noted that <span style="color:red;font-weight:bold">Navy Secretary John Phelan</span> was ordered to do so by Hegseth.<br>
The official also said that the timing of the announcement -- occurring during Pride month -- was intentional.</p>
