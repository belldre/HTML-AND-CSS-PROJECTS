        At SnoPride Bengals we are dedicated to breeding. When a SnoPride kitten leaves to go to their new home we want to help make <br>
        this transition to be as easy as possible for the new family & kitten. Our kittens have been raised in our home with our Maltese & French-bo<br>
        that take their socialization job very seriously.
        In the  13 years we have been breeding Bengals, we have always worked to improve our breeding program and have produced several Supreme Champions.<br>
        Showing our offspring keeps us in touch with the Bengal breed standard and helps us continue in our breeding goals of producing the "purrfect" Bengal.
